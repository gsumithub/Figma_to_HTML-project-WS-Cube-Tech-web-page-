# Figma_to_HTML-project-WS-Cube-Tech-web-page-
A front-end implementation of a Figma design using only HTML5 and CSS3 (Responsive across Mobile devices, Tablets and Desktop) . The goal of this project was to translate a static UI design into a clean, responsive (or fixed-layout) webpage while preserving the visual hierarchy, spacing, and component alignment from the original mockup.
